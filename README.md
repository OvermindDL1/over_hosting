# OverHosting

To start the app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`, or run the singular `mix ecto.reset` to drop, create, and migrate at once
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` if not already installed
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) from your browser.
